# Purpose
How will society address the complex challenges it faces in the future?
This is a question extremely pertinent to young people.
How will risk analysis contribute to solving these challenges?

To discuss this question the Students and Young Professionals (SYP) Committee of the Society of Risk Analysis (SRA) are hosting a summer workshop.
The workshop's theme is "Tomorrow's perspective on today's risk: technology, environment, and society".
The plan is to bring together an international group of 20-30 young risk scientists to engage on these issues, foster collaboration, and encourage learning.

The focus of the workshop will be student engagement and discussion, however we will also have the occasional workshop from an established risk professor to spur further discussion.

# When and where
The workshop will be hosted at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor over the 17-19th of May 2020.

# Registration
Registration is open until March 14th at 5pm Eastern Time (USA), when we will begin reviewing applications.

# Schedule
Participants will arrive on Sunday for a introductory dinner and welcome that evening.
On Monday and Tuesday morning we will have discussion sessions and workshops.

# More information
More information will be posted here as it becomes available.
