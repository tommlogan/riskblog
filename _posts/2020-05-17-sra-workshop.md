# Postponed
Due to COVID-19 and associated travel complications, the workshop has been postponed as of Mar-6.
We will update this site with further details as they come available.
If you are still interested, please register anyway so that we have you details and can keep you informed.

# Purpose
How will society address the complex challenges it faces in the future?
This is a question extremely pertinent to young people.
How will risk analysis contribute to solving these challenges?

To discuss this question the Students and Young Professionals (SYP) Committee of the Society of Risk Analysis (SRA) are hosting a summer workshop.
The workshop's theme is "Tomorrow's perspective on today's risk: technology, environment, and society".
The plan is to bring together an international group of 20-30 young risk scientists to engage on these issues, foster collaboration, and encourage learning.

The focus of the workshop will be student engagement and discussion, however we will also have the occasional workshop from an established risk professor to spur further discussion.

# When and where
The workshop will be hosted at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor over the 17-19th of May 2020.

# Accommodation and travel
SRA will cover lodging and some meal costs for the 2-day workshop, with limited travel funding available as well!

# Registration
Registration is open until March 14th at 5pm Eastern Time (USA), when we will begin reviewing applications.

# Schedule
Participants will arrive on Sunday for a introductory dinner and welcome that evening.
On Monday and Tuesday morning we will have discussion sessions and workshops.

# Guest speakers
Some of the workshops will be led by leading members of the Society of Risk Analysis (SRA). These include:
* Professor Seth Guikema (SRA President) - "how to write a paper for the journal of risk analysis"
* Robyn Wilson (SRA President-elect) - "how to engage with and influence policy as a risk scientist"
