**There is a Microsoft Word template at the bottom of the page that you can download.**

I'm going to keep this short.


### What is auto-numbering?
I like using the auto-numbering features in Word for headings and figures/tables. If you haven't used these before, they allow you to add a "caption" to a figure or table or a "number" to a heading that is hyperlinked throughout the document.
For example, it might say "Figure 4".
When you add a new figure before this figure and add a caption to it, Word will automatically update the original figure's caption to "Figure 5". It's very useful.

### Auto-numbering in appendices
 I'd never tried to figure out how to do this with appendices until today.
 Appendices are often labeled with letters (e.g., Appendix A, in comparison to section 1).
 They also often have different numbering schemes for the figures and tables (e.g., Table A-1).
 Word's built-in headings (or my experience of them, at least) don't make this possible.
 It turns out that it is possible - just a little bit fiddly.

### Here it is...
 I'm hoping that I've done most of the fiddling and that the template linked below is of some use to you.

 Please feel free to contact me or comment if you have any issues with it or suggestions for improvement.
