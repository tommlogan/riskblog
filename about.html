								<p>We are two New Zealand engineering PhD students at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, trying to do research that contributes to how society tackles environmental and social challenges.
									Programming, risk analysis, and engineering are providing some awesome and unique ways of doing this and that's what we want to share.
									 The views represented here are our own and do not represent the views of the University. </p>

								<p><strong>Blog Name </strong>
									is about how we can better use risk and science to tackle important global challenges.
									We post about issues relating to risk, science, and sustainability, as well as coding challenges we've overcome, tips and tricks we've learnt as we navigate through academia, and papers that we've published.
