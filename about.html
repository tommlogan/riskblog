								<p>Our world is on the brink. We are are young risk scientists working to figure out how to save it.</p>
								<p>
									We do research that contributes to how society tackles environmental and social challenges.
									Programming, risk analysis, and engineering are providing some awesome and unique ways of doing this and that's what we want to share.
									The views represented here are our own and do not represent the views of our respective universities.
								 </p>

								<p>
									<strong>Reckoning Risk </strong>
									is about how we can better use risk and science to tackle important global challenges.
									We post about issues relating to risk, science, and sustainability, as well as coding challenges we've overcome, tips and tricks we've learnt as we navigate through academia, and papers that we've published.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong> Why reckoning?</strong>
									A reckoning is an opinion.
									It is also the process of calculating or analysing something.
									But ultimately, the "day of reckoning" is where we account for our actions.
									The world we live in is finite and we must act quickly before it tips over the edge.
									<br>
									<strong> Why risk? </strong>
									Our world is at risk.
									Understanding, quantifying, and communicating these risks is of fundamental importance to society, both now and in the future.
