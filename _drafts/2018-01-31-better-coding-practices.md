Have you ever had to revisit a coding project? If you're like me, there's a sense of trepidation. Will I remember what I was doing? Will it still work?  
They say that your closest collaborator is your past self, except she/he doesn't respond to emails...

Well, I got a bit sick of that feeling and have learnt some techniques which my future self will be thankful for. And that's what I want to share with you. Note that many of these are adapted from Jeff Leek's book []().  
This is also the blog form of a workshop that I'm presenting for the INFORMS student chapter at the University of Michigan (Institute of Operations Research and Management Science). The slides for that workshop are here.
