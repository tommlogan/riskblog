Over ten years ago, as part of a youth environmental group, we urged the older decision makers to act on climate change for the sake of their *grandchildren*. About five years ago, the narrative referred to their *children*.

Together we used to speculate what it would be like watching the news and hearing about climate change impacts. How scary that thought was.

Now it's here.

And that's not even mentioning Central or South America, the Middle East, most of Africa, Australia, or Asia.

Not just the grandchildren. Not just the children. Climate change is going to effect us *all*. Starting now.

I've just finished participating in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Cities conference. The forecasts in the forthcoming assessment repot on the state of the climate are worse. Everything has gotten worse. All of the projections are trending towards what was considered "extreme case" in earlier reports.

* Scientists found that previous estimates of climate change's impacts on species were highly underestimated (https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3223)

One of the plenary speakers at the conference mentioned the discrepancy between what he read from scientists' official reports and what he heard from his scientist friends. Officially, scientists are saying that we're on vaguely the right track, and just need to go a little faster. Privately, his scientist friends voice grave concerns. They say we're not transitioning away of carbon and other green house gases at anywhere near the appropriate rate. I believe this is a broader issue of science communication and the tendency to err on the side of the status quo.

Well, I won't mince my words. We're in serious trouble. It's too late to stop climate change. We're probably going to overshoot the 2oC target set at Paris, which is far more than the 1.5oC target that scientists say will save island nations. What we must do now is prepare for this future.

We must begin, in earnest, preparations for extreme weather and sea level rise. We must change our trajectory to best mitigate and prevent worse warming.
* As scientists, our research must become action oriented.
* As engineers, our work is unethical if it ignores the risk from climate change.
* As employees, we must change the culture of our workplace to embrace sustainable alternatives.
* As citizens, we must vote, purchase, and advocate in a way that demands appropriate action.
Whatever it is, we all must act to prepare for the inevitable impacts of climate change. Now.
